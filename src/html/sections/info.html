                    <p>Laser cleaning works differently. The car is illuminated with a laser gun and the laser beams will remove any form of paint and/or rust, without damaging the metal. This is because metal has a higher ablation temperature than paint, rust and other pollutions. A difference is made between the body of the car and what may be on top, up to a molecular level. An important consequence of this is that any rust spots and rust holes get removed very selectively. The laser beam has no effect on the bare metal, we can easily shine a little longer on the risk zones without any danger: All rust will disappear but the healthy metal will still be there. This is how you achieve a result that you wonâ€™t ever achieve with other methods. The paintwork afterwards will never have been this perfect!</p>
                    <p>In terms of price, laser cleaning is comparable to the other methods. We sell the machines, but we also have technicians who can come to you and strip the car at your place. People often think that laser cleaning is much more expensive than other methods. However, this is not really true because laser cleaning is much faster, which means that the price is eventually comparable. And the result is so much better.</p>
