                    <p>For laser cleaning we are using a laser beam with a power of 1000W and more to remove surface contamination. This may not seem very much, but this power is concentrated on a very small surface, creating a very high energy density.</p>
                    <p>This way the fine point of light can generate a very strong heating on the material it is shining on in a very short amount of time. Specifically this means you only need a fraction of a second to bring metal to it’s melting point or even to it’s evaporation point. This also the way laser cutters work: the evaporate the beamed on material so they can cut a couple of centimeters of steel as if it were butter.</p>
