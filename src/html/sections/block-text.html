                    <h4>Basic principle</h4>
                    <div class="block-text__description">
                        <p>We all know a laser beam as a thin red light coming out of a laser pointer. However, laser beams can also be in different colors or even in a light frequency that isn’t visible anymore for the human eye. This kind of “invisible” laser is what is used for laser cleaning.</p>
                        <p>The power of the laser beam lies a lot higher with laser cleaning: powers of 1000W and more are used. This may seem like it’s not that much but this power is concentrated on a very small area, with a very high energy density as a result. The small point of light causes a strong heating of the material in a very short period of time. This means that you can bring a metal to its melting point, even to its evaporation in no time. This is also how laser cutters work: they start by vaporizing the material and this way they can cut through a few centimeters of steel like it’s butter.</p>
                        <p>Laser cleaning is a lot more challenging than that to realize, that is because we want to remove a layer that’s located on top of another material which we don’t want to damage or influence. How do we manage to do this?</p>

                    <h4>Pulses</h4>
                    <div class="block-text__description">
                        <p>The pollution layer has a different evaporation temperature than the underlying layer almost every time. If we choose our settings wise, we can let the top layer evaporate without damaging the underlying layer. This forms the absolute basic principle of laser cleaning. But we go one step further than this.</p>
                        <p>With laser cleaning, we make the laser beam pulsate instead of using a continuous beam like we do with laser cutting. This pulsing concentrates the power even more and gives an even quicker heating of the contaminated layer, so as a result, we are able to clean big surfaces in a short period of time.A third effect is that the laser beam can go through the contaminated layer, but gets reflected on the underlying layer. As a result of this reflection, the underlying layer doesn’t heat up as much, and at the same time the pollution is also illuminated from below, resulting in a double heating!</p>
