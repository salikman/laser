                            <p>The Laserflux laser gun is a feat of top engineering. The gun only weighs a few kilograms, the lightest on the market. There is a swiveling handle at the top that provides you with good ergonomics even in places that are very hard to reach. As required by law, the gun contains a dead man’s button and the necessary warning indications. A lighting is integrated in the handle as well.</p>
                            <p>Both the lenses and the glass cover plates are very easy to replace with a custom designed cassette system. The gun typically provides a focus depth of 10 cm, which means that you’re in focus and can clean within an area of 10 centimeters. This area usually is about 20 centimeters away from the gun, but you can adapt this with other lenses.</p>
